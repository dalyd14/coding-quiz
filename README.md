# Coding Quiz
Weekly Assignment 04

## Deliverable
AS A coding boot camp student\
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores\
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Accpetance Criteria
 * *GIVEN I am taking a code quiz*
 - WHEN I click the start button\
   THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
 - WHEN I answer a question\
   THEN I am presented with another question
 - WHEN I answer a question incorrectly\
   THEN time is subtracted from the clock
 - WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0\
   THEN the game is over
 - WHEN the game is over\
   THEN I can save my initials and score

## Approach
- I took a desktop first approach and then made it responsive for smaller screen sizes
- I will create a test bank, and the randomly draw a certain number of questions from there each time (10)
- I would like some animation between each questions; but they must be quick so it doesnt take away from the time
- Add sufficient indicators for the time and whether or not the users got the question right or wrong

## Notes
- There is a test bank of more than 10 questions in it and the quiz randomly draws ten questions from it
- I focussed mainly on the javascript. Therefore the css styling may be lacking in some places
- there is an easter egg joke question in the quiz -- Hint: the answer is null
